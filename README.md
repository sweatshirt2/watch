# Watch app
#### Currently has a working watch and stopwatch that allows users ellapse time 3 times. It allows signed up users to do as many ellapses they want and write a motto on their wall
#### The ui is the default vite + react init ui
#### It helped me revise my react knowledge by using essentials hooks such as useState, useEffect, useRef, and useContext (for user state management)
